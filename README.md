This game follows the theme of "Living in the City" as the setting is in the middle of an urban city surrounded by buildings, bright lights, and large pieces of media. Ideally, living in the city should be not only enjoyable, but also safe and give a sense of exploration in a large setting as shown in the game. Furthermore, this game also illustrates a sense of urgency or an objective when in the city, as usually living in the city can also be where people have a job to do and an objective to accomplish.
